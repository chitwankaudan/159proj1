    "\n",
    "A [2013 Gaurdian Report](hhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/feb/12/state-of-the-union-reading-level) used the Flesch-Kincaid Reading Test and found that Presidential speeches and writings have declined in complexity and reading level over time. We decided to test this theory. We analyzed a set of State of the Union Addresses from 1790 to 2017 to analyze the variation in speaking styles amongst US Presidents and analyze how these speaking style evovle over the course of American history. We found that average sentence length and average word length have declined over time. We also found that word length is closely correlated with President's individual speaking styles. So what a President may vary the length of his speech or even the length of his sentences over time, he doesn't tend to vary the size of the words he chooses significantly. Using an MDS analysis we found a clear distinction between words chosen by earlier presidents and words chosen by more modern presidents. Finally, through our sentiment analysis, we discovered that \n",

Another thing we noted was that the Unique Cleaned Words and Stemmed Unique Cleaned Words plots had a smaller relative gaps between their peaks. From this we gathered that while there was large range of speech lengths, the distribution of the number of unique words and stemmed uniqued words was much narrower.\n",

We expected speech length to increase over time since overtime America became larger so there was more to report on when describing the state of the union.

We speculated modern day speeches would be a lot longer since the modern President has to address a diverese set of audience's concerns. \n",

Since 1820, speech lengths have fluctuated but remained around the same at approximately 244 sentences and 2,980 words. There doesn't seem to be an obvious increasing or decreasing trend in speech length since the 1840s. \n",

This is really interesting because even though we correctly predicted sentences length and word length decline, this did not result in a higher proportion of stop words. This might be because addresses went from being written letters which have clear punctuations to spoken transcripts where punctuations are less important. It is also possible that modern Presidents are ending sentences with unconvential stop words."

    "## Working with the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before executing further analyses, we needed to find a way to make the data more manegable. This speech data is very rich, and has lots of overlap; if we tried to run analyses using the speech transcripts themselves, it would take far too long. The solution is to manipulate the data to a more efficient structure. To do this we create a frequency matrix `wmat`. Our indices are the unique word stems that we find across all speeches, and our columns are individual speeches. If a cell in row `thank` and column `0` has a value of 4, then we know that the stem `thank` appeared in the first speech 4 times. Clearly this data structure takes up far less memory and is more readily compatible with analysis packages than the richer text data was.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting artifact of the data type is that our frequency matrix is incredibly sparse. In fact, 93% of the individual cells are zeros. This might seem to indicate that this data structure is not the most efficient means of analysing the speeches. However, once we think about the data generating process, the sparsity makes sense. The first large source of sparsity is the exclusion of stopwords, we immedietly remove quite a few words that would be common across all speeches. Once the stopwords are removed, whats left are vocabulary that would readily change from president to president and year to year. The spoken word goes through many iterations even within one presidental term, so expecting large amounts of overlap between speeches might not seem plausible. In this light, the sparsity is not a cause for alarm. In fact, it is an indication that we are extracting only the relevant data from the speech transcripts."

We found little in the way of clear trends, with quite a bit of variation over time for both positive and negative word usage, but did notice that the positive/negative ratio generally sat at or above 1.0, indicating overall more positive than negative word usage, which is interesting considering that the negative opinion lexicon we used is over twice as large as the positive opinion lexicon (4783 words vs. 2006 words).\n",

    "Lastly, we wondered how sentiment might change over time throughout presidencies that presided over large-scale wars. Since the United States has been at war most of its history, we focused our attention on only four wars--the Civil War, World Wars I and II, and the Vietnam War. The first three wars we included due to their size and fatality, and the last we included because of how public opinion of war and the military changed throughout the Vietnam War. We were interested to see whether presiding over a war drastically changed individual presidents' sentiment before, during, and after the wars, as well as how different sentiment among presidents during a particular war may differ, where applicable. It is worth noting that with the exception of World War I, all other wars we considered ended only a few months into the presidency of the last presiding president, due either to the previous president's death (Lincoln, Roosevelt) or resignation (Nixon).\n",

    "We didn't notice clear trends through either World War I or the Vietnam War, but noted that positive/negative ratio appeared to climb through the Civil War and drop through World War II."
